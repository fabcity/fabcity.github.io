        <h2>1. A Changing World Calls for New Territorial Models</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">Communities everywhere are facing the same pressures: supply systems break, ecosystems decline, cultural memory weakens, and technology moves faster than our capacity to use it responsibly. The industrial logic of the past century can no longer guide the next one. It depends on distant production, long material chains, and a pattern of extraction that leaves territories fragile.</p>
        <p>Fab City offers a different path. It supports local capacity, global collaboration, and ecological responsibility. It shifts from moving products to moving knowledge. It invites every territory to produce more of what it needs within its ecological limits.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card" id="learning">
        <h2>2. Territories Thrive When They Become Learning Ecosystems</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">Real change grows from real challenges. When communities work together to understand their territory and build solutions that fit their context, learning becomes active and shared. Skills grow through practice. Knowledge becomes collective strength. Innovation becomes a public good.</p>
        <p>A Fab City is a place where learning is continuous, hands-on, and shaped by the territory itself.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card" id="hubs">
        <h2>3. Fab City Hubs Are the Civic Engines of Transformation</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">Fab Labs have shown what happens when people gain access to tools, knowledge, and global peers. They help communities repair, prototype, and explore new ideas. Fab City Hubs expand this role.</p>
        <p>A Fab City Hub connects makers, educators, technologists, artisans, policymakers, and citizens. It supports fabrication, sensing, ecological monitoring, material innovation, and locally tuned intelligence. It helps territories read their own systems and act with intention.</p>
        <p><strong>A Hub is not only a workshop. It is a civic space for learning, coordination, and regenerative development.</strong></p>
      </article>

      <article class="card" id="fullstack">
        <h2>4. The Fab City Full Stack Is Our Shared Protocol</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">To guide territorial transformation we need a shared approach. The Fab City Full Stack offers a common protocol that keeps local autonomy and global collaboration in balance. It aligns learning, production, and governance from the household to the bioregion.</p>
        <p>The Full Stack is a navigation tool. It supports diverse cultural, ecological, and economic realities while creating a common language for collective action.</p>

      <article class="card" id="action">
        <h2>5. The Fab City Challenge Is Our Common Practice</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">The Fab City Challenge is a continuous cycle of identifying local issues, gathering actors, building prototypes, testing ideas, and sharing results. It invites territories to learn by doing and to learn together.</p>
        <p>Each cycle strengthens local capacity and contributes to a shared global commons of methods, designs, and insights. Territories working on their own problems become part of a single distributed engine of innovation and regeneration.</p>

      <article class="card" id="intelligence">
        <h2>6. We Commit to Hybrid and Shared Intelligence</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">The future will be shaped by territories that combine all their forms of intelligence:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ecological knowledge held by landscapes and local stewards.</li>
          <li>Cultural memory carried by craft, story, and practice.</li>
          <li>Technological skill from makers, designers, and researchers.</li>
          <li>Artificial intelligence adapted to local data, languages, and needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fab City Hubs bring these intelligences together to build autonomy and resilience.</p>

      <article class="card" id="sovereignty">
        <h2>7. Sovereignty Means the Power to Choose</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">Territorial sovereignty is the ability to make informed decisions, produce responsibly, and guide one’s own development. It grows through shared protocols, open technologies, and cooperation across borders. Territories that learn together strengthen one another.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card" id="regeneration">
        <h2>8. Regeneration Is Our North Star</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">A Fab City must do more than produce. It must regenerate. It restores ecosystems, strengthens cultures, and grows local capability. It works with land and materials. It values repair, circular flows, and long-term stewardship. It builds conditions for sustained community well-being.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card" id="movement">
        <h2>9. The Fab City Movement Is a Collective Undertaking</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">This charter invites governments, makers, educators, researchers, entrepreneurs, cultural workers, farmers, activists, and citizens to take part. No single institution can change a territory alone. Together we can build systems that are resilient, fair, and grounded in place.</p>
        <p class="small">Joining the Fab City movement is a commitment to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>produce responsibly,</li>
          <li>waste less,</li>
          <li>regenerate ecosystems,</li>
          <li>share knowledge openly,</li>
          <li>and collaborate across cultures and borders.</li>
        </ul>

      <article class="card" id="commit">
        <h2>10. A Shared Commitment to the Long Horizon</h2>
        <p class="lead-para">The Fab City Charter is a call to think in generations. It invites the building of infrastructures that support decades of learning and collaboration. It is a commitment to future communities who will inherit the systems we create today.</p>
        <p>Fab City is ready for its next phase. The network exists. The methods are proven. The hubs are growing. The tools are in our hands.</p>
