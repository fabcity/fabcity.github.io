title: Roadmap
subtitle: Our Roadmap is unique. Launched in 2011 by the City of Barcelona, it is
  now in constant development thanks to our distributed network. We employ a collective approach
  of ‘learning-by-doing’ to constantly prototype, experiment, succeed and fail on the path towards our goals.
