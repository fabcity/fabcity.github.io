description: In 2014, the then mayor of Barcelona challenged cities to produce everything they consume by 2054. The Fab City Global Initiative supports this shift from a Product-in Trash-out to a Data-in Data-out urban model. It comprises a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#global-initiative">Network</a> of 28 cities, a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#fab-city-collective">core group of Collective members</a> and is governed by a foundation. Supported by our global community, we work to change the urban paradigm to make locally productive, globally connected cities and citizens.
