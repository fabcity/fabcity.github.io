It  comprises a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#global-initiative">network</a> of 28 cities, a <a class="underlined-blue page-scroll" href="#fab-city-collective">core team of collective members</a> and is governed by a foundation, all working to change the urban paradigm of yesterday, and make the cities of tomorrow.'
